### TRANSROMS

>With CSS3 came new ways to position and alter elements. Now general layout techniques can be revisited  
with alternative ways to size, position, and change elements. All of these new techniques are made possible   
by the transform property.   
The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each   
of these come with their own individual properties and values.  
Within this lesson we’ll take a look at both two-dimensional and three-dimensional transforms. Generally   
speaking, browser support for the transform property isn’t great, but it is getting better every day. For  
the best support vendor prefixes are encouraged, however you may need to download the nightly version of  
Chrome to see all of these transforms in action.  

## 2D Rotate
>The transform property accepts a handful of different values. The rotate value provides the ability    
to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees. Using a positive value will rotate an element clockwise,   
and using a negative value will rotate the element counterclockwise. The default point of rotation  
is the center of the element, 50% 50%, both horizontally and vertically. Later we will discuss how  
you can change this default point of rotation.  

# HTML
><figure class="box-1">Box 1</figure> 
<figure class="box-2">Box 2</figure> 
             
# CSS  
>.box-1 {  
  transform: rotate(20deg);  
}  
.box-2 {  
  transform: rotate(-55deg);    
  }  
  
 ### Transitions  
  
>As mentioned, for a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different   
styles must be identified for each state. The easiest way for determining styles for different states  
is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.  
There are four transition related properties in total, including transition-property, transition-duration,    
transition-timing-function, and transition-delay. Not all of these are required to build a transition, with  
the first three are the most popular.   
In the example below the box will change its background color over the course of 1 second in a linear fashion.  

>.box {  
  background: #2db34a;  
  transition-property: background;  
  transition-duration: 1s;  
  transition-timing-function: linear;  
}  
.box:hover {  
  background: #ff7b29;  
}  

### Transition Timing  

>The transition-timing-function property is used to set the speed in which a transition will move.  
Knowing the duration from the transition-duration property a transition can have multiple speeds   
within a single duration. A few of the more popular keyword values for the transition-timing-function   
property include linear, ease-in, ease-out, and ease-in-out.  
The linear keyword value identifies a transition moving in a constant speed from one state to another.   
The ease-in value identifies a transition that starts slowly and speeds up throughout the transition,   
while the ease-out value identifies a transition that starts quickly and slows down throughout the  
transition. The ease-in-out value identifies a transition that starts slowly, speeds up in the middle,   
then slows down again before ending.
